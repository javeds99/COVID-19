# Global COVID-19 Cases and Deaths

The goal of this project was to learn how to source my own data and further develop my data cleaning/analysis skills.

- What is the total amount of COVID-19 deaths worldwide?
- Which country/countries have the highest number of cases/deaths? Which country/countries have the lowest number of cases/deaths?
-
