# Global COVID-19 Cases and Deaths

The goal of this project was to learn how to source my own data and further develop my data cleaning/analysis skills. COVID-19 has impacted the globe since early 2020, and while the virus is still relatively new, there are many questions surrounding it. The main questions that this analysis aims to answer are:

- What is the total amount of COVID-19 deaths worldwide?
- Which country/countries have the highest number of cases/deaths? Which country/countries have the lowest number of cases/deaths?
- Is there any relationship between cases and deaths?
- Between 2020 and 2021, which year was worse for COVID-19 cases and deaths?



**<ins>Data Limitations:<ins/>**
  
The dataset does not include ages or age groups, which would have really helped the analysis. Some deaths/cases were also misdiagnosed and retracted from the WHO database.

  
  **This dataset was last updated on November 23, 2021 by the World Health Organization. It contains global COVID-19 case/death data from 2020-2021.**

 - The total number of global COVID-19 cases seems to drastically outnumber the number of deaths. This finding was a great insight, as it helped dive deeper into the data.

 - This visual shows the total cases and deaths of each country. As shown, United States, India and Brazil are the main countries effected by COVID-19, as they lead in death and case counts.

 - We can see that the number of deaths in comparison to the total cases is small.

 - There is a positive relationship between cases and deaths.
  
  
  **<ins>Summary:<ins/>**
  
COVID-19 has impacted the entire globe in different ways. Some regions experienced high case numbers, as high as 43 million, while some countries never broke 5,000 cases. Furthermore, a strong correlation between cases and death was found. As cases increase, so does the death count. However, the death count in comparison to the number of cases is smaller. For example, the United States recorded 43 million cases, but only 767,000 deaths in comparison to the high case numbers. The data also shows that heavily populated countries such as India and Brazil experience the highest number of cases and deaths. With these insights and findings, it appears that COVID-19 will spread to more people in heavily populated areas. However, the number of deaths compared to the number of cases indicate that while precautions and protocols would be good, it would make more sense to prioritize the vulnerable populations, as COVID-19 affects older individuals.
