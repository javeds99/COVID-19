# Global COVID-19 Cases and Deaths

The goal of this project was to learn how to source my own data and further develop my data cleaning/analysis skills. COVID-19 has impacted the globe since early 2020, and while the virus is still relatively new, there are many questions surrounding it. The main questions that this analysis aims to answer are:

- What is the total amount of COVID-19 deaths worldwide?
- Which country/countries have the highest number of cases/deaths? Which country/countries have the lowest number of cases/deaths?
- Is there any relationship between cases and deaths?
- Between 2020 and 2021, which year was worse for COVID-19 cases and deaths?



**<ins>Data Limitations:<ins/>**
  
The dataset does not include ages or age groups, which would have really helped the analysis. Some deaths/cases were also misdiagnosed and retracted from the WHO database.


**<ins>Total Amount of Global COVID-19 Deaths:<ins/>**
  
 The total amount of worldwide COVID-19 deaths is **5.2 million**.
